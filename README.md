## Project

#### Purpose
Analyze the pricing history of 5 products and generate a model to optimize the price and get the maximum revenue.

#### Skills and Methods
* Data exploration and visualization
* Price and demand elasticity calculation
* Modeling the Effect of discounts on products with OLS
* Modeling the optimized price by product using Generalized Additive Model

#### Results
The final model was created with `PyGAM`, presenting the price point that maximizes the revenue. The predictions are within a 95% confidence band.
